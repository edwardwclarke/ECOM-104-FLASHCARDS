const flashcards = [
  // Capital Structure & MM I
  { question: "What does MM Proposition I state?", answer: "In a frictionless world, capital structure is irrelevant to firm value." },
  { question: "What are key assumptions of MM I?", answer: "No taxes, no transaction costs, no information asymmetry, same borrowing/lending rate." },
  { question: "What is the pie analogy in MM?", answer: "Firm value (pie size) depends only on investment policy, not how it's sliced between debt and equity." },

  // Arbitrage Example
  { question: "What happens if MM is violated (Firm A > Firm B)?", answer: "Arbitrage opportunity: sell overvalued firm and buy undervalued firm's components." },

  // MM II and Cost of Capital
  { question: "What does MM Proposition II state?", answer: "Cost of levered equity = cost of unlevered equity + premium based on D/E ratio." },
  { question: "What happens to WACC under MM?", answer: "WACC remains constant regardless of leverage if there are no frictions." },

  // WACC Fallacy
  { question: "Why is 'debt is cheaper than equity so we should increase debt' fallacious?", answer: "More debt increases risk of both equity and existing debt — total cost of capital stays the same." },

  // EPS Fallacy
  { question: "What is the EPS fallacy?", answer: "Increasing leverage may raise EPS but also increases its risk — price per share doesn't necessarily increase." },
  { question: "Why might EPS go up and share price stay flat?", answer: "Because higher EPS comes with higher risk, which increases cost of equity." },

  // Empirical Evidence - Industries
  { question: "Which industry has the highest leverage based on Net Debt/(Debt + MV Equity)?", answer: "Banks: 0.67" },
  { question: "Which sectors had negative net debt ratios?", answer: "Pharma, Semiconductors, Business Services, etc. (net cash positions)" },

  // Empirical Evidence - Countries
  { question: "Which country had highest net debt ratio?", answer: "Slovakia: 0.64" },
  { question: "Which country had one of the lowest net debt ratios?", answer: "Poland: 0.01" },

  // Poll Review
  { question: "Poll: Most common source of funds for firms?", answer: "Internal funds" },
  { question: "Poll: Historically larger — market or book debt ratio?", answer: "Book debt ratio" },
  { question: "Poll: MM Prop I — value of firm depends on?", answer: "Investment policy" },
  { question: "Poll: What assumption is NOT needed for MM?", answer: "No international trade" },
  { question: "Poll: Arbitrage with A overvalued and B undervalued?", answer: "Sell A and buy B's debt + equity" },
  { question: "Poll: Which WACC fact is correct?", answer: "WACC does not change with leverage under MM assumptions" },
  { question: "Poll: EPS Fallacy — key insight?", answer: "Expected EPS increases, but becomes riskier with leverage" }
