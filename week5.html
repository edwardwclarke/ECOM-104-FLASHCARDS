  // Basic Facts
  { question: "What is Blaine Kitchenware’s ROE before the recap?", answer: "11.0%, below the industry average of 25.9%" },
  { question: "How much cash and marketable securities did Blaine hold in 2006?", answer: "$231 million" },
  { question: "What is Blaine proposing to do?", answer: "Borrow $50M at 6.75% and use that plus $209M of cash to repurchase 14M shares at $18.50." },

  // Leverage & Balance Sheet
  { question: "What is the post-recap debt-to-equity ratio?", answer: "22%" },
  { question: "What is the post-recap debt-to-total capital ratio?", answer: "18%" },
  { question: "What is Blaine’s net debt after repurchase?", answer: "$28.1M (50M debt - 21.9M cash)" },

  // Interest Coverage & Distress Risk
  { question: "What is Blaine’s post-recap interest coverage ratio?", answer: "EBIT of $63.9M / $3.375M interest = 19x" },
  { question: "Is Blaine at risk of financial distress post-recap?", answer: "Unlikely, interest coverage is strong and leverage remains low." },

  // Peer Comparison
  { question: "How does Blaine’s leverage compare to peers?", answer: "Blaine is much less levered (22% D/E vs peers at 49–187%)" },

  // Tax Shields
  { question: "How do tax shields affect firm value?", answer: "They reduce taxes paid and add to firm value: PV(Tax Shield) = t × D" },
  { question: "What is the PV of tax shield for $50M debt at 31% tax?", answer: "$15.5M" },
  { question: "What if t = 40%?", answer: "$20M PV tax shield" },
  { question: "What is the tax shield from net debt change ($259M)?", answer: "$80.3M (at 31%) or $104M (at 40%)" },

  // EPS & ROE Effects
  { question: "How does the recap affect EPS and ROE?", answer: "EPS increases from $0.91 to $0.95; ROE from 11% to 18.7%" },
  { question: "What drives the increase in ROE?", answer: "Primarily financial leverage; small contribution from tax shield." },
  { question: "What is the mechanical (tax-free) ROE after recap?", answer: "16.6%" },
  { question: "What is the value-added ROE from taxes?", answer: "2.1% (18.7% − 16.6%)" },

  // Shareholder Impact
  { question: "How does the recap affect shareholders’ after-tax income?", answer: "Gains due to tax efficiency and cash being returned to owners." },
  { question: "Why does the share price increase only ~$0.26 on tax gains?", answer: "Because the market already anticipates part of the value from the announcement." },

  // Repurchase vs Premium
  { question: "Is Blaine overpaying by offering a $2.25 premium?", answer: "No — total payout is fixed ($259M), premium only affects who sells." },

  // Control & Governance
  { question: "What happens to family control if they don’t tender?", answer: "Increases from 62% to 81%" },
  { question: "If the family tenders like everyone else?", answer: "Control remains unchanged at 62%" },

  // Risks
  { question: "What are risks of recapitalizing Blaine?", answer: "Less flexibility for acquisitions, exposure to economic downturns, potential for distress." },

  // Financial Distress
  { question: "What are costs of financial distress (CFD)?", answer: "Legal fees, lost customers, staff departures, reduced R&D, etc." },
  { question: "What is the formula to estimate PV of CFD?", answer: "PV(CFD) = probability × cost in distress" },

  // Trade-Off Theory
  { question: "What is the trade-off theory of capital structure?", answer: "Firms balance tax shield benefits with costs of financial distress." },
  { question: "Where is Blaine on the static trade-off curve?", answer: "Well below optimal debt (negative net debt), so recap moves it closer to value-maximizing capital structure." },

  // Summary
  { question: "Does the recap create value?", answer: "Yes, via tax shields and efficient capital return." },
  { question: "Should Blaine proceed with the recap?", answer: "Yes — if they can manage risks and align with long-term strategy." }
