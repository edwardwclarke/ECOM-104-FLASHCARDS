      { q: "What is an exchange rate?", a: "The amount of one currency needed to purchase one unit of another currency." },
      { q: "Define spot rate and forward rate of exchange.", a: "Spot rate is for immediate transactions; forward rate is for transactions at a future date." },
      { q: "What does it mean if a currency is at a forward premium?", a: "It means you can buy more foreign currency at the forward rate than at the spot rate." },
      { q: "What is transaction exposure?", a: "Exposure from foreign currency receivables or payables due to timing differences." },
      { q: "What is economic exposure?", a: "Currency risk arising from competitive impacts of exchange rate changes." },
      { q: "How can a company hedge currency risk?", a: "By selling the foreign currency forward or borrowing in that currency and selling spot." },
      { q: "What is interest rate parity?", a: "It states that the ratio of forward to spot exchange rates equals the ratio of interest rates in two countries." },
      { q: "What is the expectations theory of exchange rates?", a: "It assumes the forward rate equals the expected future spot rate." },
      { q: "What is purchasing power parity?", a: "Exchange rates adjust to offset inflation differences between countries." },
      { q: "What is the cost of hedging?", a: "It's the difference between the forward rate and the expected future spot rate." },
      { q: "How does operational hedging work?", a: "By balancing production and sales in the same currency zones." },
      { q: "What are the two methods to evaluate international projects?", a: "1. Discount foreign cash flows at foreign rate and convert, or 2. Convert at forward rate and discount at home rate." },
      { q: "Why separate investment from exchange rate hedging?", a: "To avoid rejecting profitable projects due to expected currency changes." }
