const flashcards = [
  // Pecking Order Theory
  { question: "What is the pecking order of financing?", answer: "1. Internal funds, 2. Debt, 3. Equity" },
  { question: "Why do firms follow the pecking order?", answer: "To avoid the high costs of asymmetric information and underpricing of equity." },
  { question: "Why are firms reluctant to issue new equity?", answer: "Because it can be interpreted as a negative signal and cause stock price to fall." },

  // Equity Issuance and Market Reaction
  { question: "What happens to stock price when firms issue equity?", answer: "Stock price often falls due to perceived negative information." },
  { question: "What events increase stock prices?", answer: "Leverage increases like share repurchases and dividend initiations." },

  // Asymmetric Information
  { question: "What is the cost of information asymmetry?", answer: "Good firms get undervalued when markets cannot differentiate them from bad firms." },
  { question: "What happens when equity is issued under asymmetry?", answer: "Existing shareholders lose value due to underpricing." },

  // Event Study
  { question: "How do equity issues affect abnormal stock returns?", answer: "-3.1% on average" },
  { question: "What is the effect of share repurchases?", answer: "+3.6% to +16.2% depending on method" },
  { question: "What is the market reaction to dividend cuts?", answer: "-3.6%" },

  // Examples
  { question: "In the no asymmetry example, who captures NPV?", answer: "Existing shareholders" },
  { question: "In the asymmetry example, who benefits?", answer: "New shareholders benefit, existing shareholders lose value" },

  // Debt vs Equity
  { question: "Why is safe debt preferred under asymmetry?", answer: "Because it's not underpriced — its value is not sensitive to firm type." },
  { question: "Is risky debt better than equity?", answer: "Yes — less underpricing than equity." },
  { question: "What is the firm value if a good firm uses safe debt?", answer: "£110M (same as under full info)" },

  // Hybrid Securities
  { question: "Why issue preferred stock?", answer: "Fixed payout like debt, less underpricing than equity." },
  { question: "What is convertible debt?", answer: "Debt that can convert to shares — gets equity into capital structure without immediate dilution." },

  // Signaling
  { question: "What is signaling in finance?", answer: "Good types send costly signals to separate themselves from bad types." },

  // Lemon’s Problem
  { question: "What is the market for lemons problem?", answer: "Only bad assets are sold when buyers can't distinguish quality — good firms stay out." },

  // Polls
  { question: "Poll: What is the pecking order of financing?", answer: "Internal funds > debt > external equity" },
  { question: "Poll: What is the market reaction to equity issuance?", answer: "Generally negative — signals overvaluation or bad news." },
  { question: "Poll: What drives pecking order theory?", answer: "Information asymmetry" },
  { question: "Poll: What is the lemons problem?", answer: "Buyers can't tell quality, good assets are withheld, only lemons are sold." },
  { question: "Poll: What makes a signal credible in signaling theory?", answer: "It must be more costly for bad firms than for good ones." },
  { question: "Poll: Who captures NPV with no asymmetry?", answer: "Existing shareholders" },
  { question: "Poll: Who captures NPV under asymmetry?", answer: "Some is transferred to bad firms — existing shareholders lose part of the value." },
  { question: "Poll: Why is debt preferred under asymmetry?", answer: "Less information-sensitive than equity, safer debt has no underpricing." },
  { question: "Poll: What do good firms do under severe underpricing?", answer: "Avoid equity issuance unless absolutely necessary." },
  { question: "Poll: Which firms hoard more cash?", answer: "Small companies with low tangible assets (more asymmetric info)" }
