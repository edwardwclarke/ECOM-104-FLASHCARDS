const flashcards = [
  // MM with Corporate Taxes
  { question: "How does debt create value in a world with corporate taxes?", answer: "Interest is tax-deductible, reducing tax liability and increasing firm value." },
  { question: "What is the formula for the value of a levered firm with corporate taxes?", answer: "VL = VU + PV(Tax Shield)" },
  { question: "How do we discount tax shields with fixed interest payments?", answer: "Use the cost of debt (rD) because the shield is as safe as debt." },

  // WACC and Taxes
  { question: "What happens to WACC with leverage in a tax world?", answer: "WACC decreases due to the tax shield on debt interest." },
  { question: "What is the new WACC formula with taxes?", answer: "WACC = (E/V)×rE + (D/V)×rD×(1−Tc)" },

  // MM II with Taxes
  { question: "How does rE change with leverage in MM II with taxes?", answer: "rE increases with D/E, but WACC still decreases overall due to tax shield." },

  // Share Price & Recapitalization
  { question: "How does a leveraged recap affect share price with taxes?", answer: "Stock price rises immediately on announcement due to tax shield value." },
  { question: "When is value created in recapitalization?", answer: "Only if debt replaces equity — not just by borrowing and holding cash." },

  // Personal Taxes
  { question: "How do personal taxes affect debt vs equity preference?", answer: "If personal taxes on debt income are higher, equity may be preferred by investors." },
  { question: "What is the adjusted firm value with corporate and personal taxes?", answer: "VL = VU + (1−(1−TD)/(1−TC)(1−TE))×D" },

  // Financial Distress
  { question: "What are financial distress costs?", answer: "Costs from actual or potential default, including legal, reputational, and lost business." },
  { question: "What are direct costs of financial distress?", answer: "Legal fees, court costs, advisory fees, time with creditors, fire-sale of assets." },
  { question: "What are indirect costs?", answer: "Lost customers, suppliers, R&D cuts, staff departures, market share losses, conflict of interest." },

  // Examples of Distress Costs
  { question: "What is an example of large direct distress costs?", answer: "Energy Future Holdings: ~$600k/day in legal and advisory fees during Ch. 11." },

  // Trade-off Theory
  { question: "What is the Trade-off Theory?", answer: "Firms balance tax advantages of debt against financial distress costs to determine leverage." },
  { question: "Why don't firms use 100% debt even if tax shield exists?", answer: "Because distress risk and costs increase with leverage." },

  // Optimal Leverage Implications
  { question: "Which types of firms tend to have higher debt?", answer: "Firms with stable cash flows and tangible assets (e.g., utilities)." },
  { question: "Which types of firms tend to have lower debt?", answer: "Firms with volatile cash flows or high R&D (e.g., tech, biotech)." },

  // Polls from Slides
  { question: "Poll: Which statements are true about tax shields?", answer: "Tax shields increase firm value and total cash flow by lowering tax payments." },
  { question: "Poll: What happens to WACC with leverage and taxes?", answer: "WACC decreases because debt has tax-advantaged cost." },
  { question: "Poll: Which discount rate is used for tax shield with fixed debt?", answer: "Cost of debt (rD) since interest is predetermined." },
  { question: "Poll: Effect of leveraged recap on share price?", answer: "Share price increases at announcement due to new tax shield." },
  { question: "Poll: Which statement is true about personal taxes?", answer: "Debt may be disadvantaged at personal level, lowering its tax benefit." },
  { question: "Poll: What are direct costs of distress?", answer: "Legal fees, court costs, dealing with creditors." },
  { question: "Poll: What are indirect costs of distress?", answer: "Lost R&D, customers, employee departures, market share losses." },
  { question: "Poll: What does trade-off theory state?", answer: "Firms should balance tax shields against distress costs when choosing debt level." },
  { question: "Poll: Which firms have higher leverage?", answer: "Firms with tangible assets and predictable cash flows." },
  { question: "Poll: Which firms have lower leverage?", answer: "Firms with intangible assets and volatile earnings (e.g., tech)." }
