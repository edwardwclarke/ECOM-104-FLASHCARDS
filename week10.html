  // IPO Process
  { question: "List the 8 major steps in the IPO process.", answer: "1. Appoint underwriters, 2. Agree on spread & greenshoe, 3. File registration, 4. Roadshow, 5. Price is set, 6. Stock allotted, 7. Price stabilization, 8. Quiet period ends." },
  { question: "What is a greenshoe option?", answer: "Allows underwriters to issue 15% more shares if demand is high." },

  // Underwriting
  { question: "What is firm commitment vs best efforts?", answer: "Firm: bank buys shares and bears risk. Best efforts: bank sells what it can." },
  { question: "List underwriter risks.", answer: "1. Insufficient demand, 2. Price risk, 3. Legal/reputation risk." },

  // Rights Issues
  { question: "How does a rights issue work?", answer: "Current shareholders can buy new shares at a discount, usually proportionally to their holdings." },
  { question: "Does underpricing in rights issues hurt shareholders?", answer: "No — if they exercise rights or sell them, they’re not harmed." },

  // Empirical IPO Evidence
  { question: "What’s the average first-day IPO return?", answer: "Around 16% (underpricing)" },
  { question: "What’s the long-run return of IPOs?", answer: "Low — 3-year average ~34% vs 62% for small stock benchmarks." },
  { question: "Is underpricing observed globally?", answer: "Yes — it’s found across all countries and is more common for small/young firms." },

  // Theories for Underpricing
  { question: "Why are IPOs underpriced (3 main reasons)?", answer: "1. Price support by underwriter, 2. Risk-averse owners want guaranteed success, 3. Asymmetric info (e.g., winner’s curse)." },
  { question: "What is the winner’s curse?", answer: "If you win a bid for an IPO, it may mean others (better informed) passed on it — you overpaid." },
  { question: "What is the key role of informed vs uninformed investors?", answer: "Uninformed must expect 0% return or won’t participate; leads to needed underpricing." },

  // Quiz Concepts
  { question: "Poll: Which type of offering has higher costs — IPO or SEO?", answer: "IPO has higher costs." },
  { question: "Poll: Why do firms underprice IPOs?", answer: "To compensate uninformed investors, ensure participation, and reduce allocation risk." },
  { question: "Poll: Who bears most cost in IPO underpricing?", answer: "Founders — value transferred to new shareholders below market value." }
