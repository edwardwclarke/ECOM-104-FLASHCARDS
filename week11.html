  // Definitions
  { question: "What is a merger?", answer: "Two firms mutually decide to combine into a new entity." },
  { question: "What is a takeover?", answer: "Acquisition by one firm of another; acquirer gains control." },
  { question: "What is a buyout?", answer: "Acquisition of a public firm to take it private." },

  // Types of Mergers
  { question: "What are horizontal mergers?", answer: "Firms in the same industry and stage of production." },
  { question: "What are vertical mergers?", answer: "Firms in same industry but at different production stages." },
  { question: "What are conglomerate mergers?", answer: "Firms in completely different industries." },

  // Hostile Takeovers
  { question: "What is a tender offer?", answer: "Offer made directly to shareholders in a hostile takeover." },
  { question: "What is a white knight?", answer: "Friendly third party that acquires the target to prevent a hostile takeover." },

  // Historical Waves (US)
  { question: "What characterized the 1890s M&A wave?", answer: "Horizontal mergers to create monopolies; led to Sherman Act." },
  { question: "What defined the 1980s wave?", answer: "Hostile takeovers, LBOs, and corporate raiders." },
  { question: "What are trends in 2010s–2020s M&A?", answer: "Tech-driven, platform acquisitions, private equity, ecosystem-building." },

  // Empirical Evidence
  { question: "Do acquirers benefit from mergers?", answer: "Usually not — acquirer stock drops ~3% on average." },
  { question: "Do targets benefit?", answer: "Yes — target stock rises ~24% on average at announcement." },
  { question: "What is the market reaction to all-cash deals?", answer: "Higher than stock deals; viewed as stronger signal." },
  { question: "How does competition affect bidder returns?", answer: "Returns are lower when multiple bidders compete." },

  // Valid Sources of Value
  { question: "Name valid merger value sources.", answer: "Restructuring, synergies, scale/scope economies, tax savings, better management." },
  { question: "What is synergy?", answer: "Combined firm generates more value than separate entities." },

  // Dubious Sources
  { question: "What are dubious sources of merger value?", answer: "Lowering financial cost, diversification, EPS increase, empire building." },
  { question: "What is the EPS bootstrap effect?", answer: "Apparent EPS rise from acquiring lower P/E target; doesn't reflect true value gain." },
  { question: "What is the diversification discount?", answer: "Diversified firms trade below sum of parts — destroys value." },
  { question: "What is Roll's Hubris Hypothesis?", answer: "CEOs overestimate their ability to create value from targets." },

  // Estimating Merger Gains
  { question: "What is the NPV of a merger?", answer: "NPV = PV(gains) – cost of acquisition" },
  { question: "How is cost calculated in a stock merger?", answer: "Shares issued × post-merger firm value – pre-merger target value" },

  // Merger Example
  { question: "In a merger with €40M cost savings, cost of capital 11%, what’s the synergy?", answer: "€40M / 0.11 = €364M" },
  { question: "Cash bid cost = €1.4B, target value = €1.1B. What’s the cost?", answer: "€1.4B – €1.1B = €0.3B" },

  // Defense Mechanisms
  { question: "What is greenmail?", answer: "Target buys back raider's shares at a premium to prevent takeover." },
  { question: "What is a poison pill?", answer: "Allows shareholders to buy shares cheaply to dilute hostile bidder’s stake." },
  { question: "What is a shark repellent?", answer: "Charter changes to deter hostile takeovers." },

  // Takeover Defense Arguments
  { question: "Why defend against takeovers?", answer: "To gain bargaining power, protect long-term strategy, or extract higher offers." },
  { question: "What’s the stock market reaction to poison pills?", answer: "Stock drops ~2% on announcement." },

  // Summary Questions
  { question: "Who typically gains in a merger?", answer: "Target shareholders, lawyers, brokers, and some executives." },
  { question: "Who typically loses?", answer: "Acquirer shareholders (due to overpayment), and employees (due to restructuring)." }
