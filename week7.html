  // Core Conflicts
  { question: "Why do conflicts arise between debt and equity holders?", answer: "Because shareholders benefit from upside but are protected from downside due to limited liability, leading to risk-taking behavior." },
  { question: "What are the 4 main types of conflicts between debt and equity?", answer: "1. Asset substitution, 2. Debt overhang, 3. Shortsighted investment, 4. Reluctance to liquidate" },

  // Asset Substitution
  { question: "What is the asset substitution problem?", answer: "Equity-holders prefer riskier projects that may benefit them at the expense of debt-holders." },
  { question: "Why does asset substitution happen?", answer: "Equity acts like a call option — captures the upside, avoids the downside." },

  // Asset Substitution Example
  { question: "In the asset substitution example, which project is preferred by equity holders when debt is issued?", answer: "Project B — higher variance benefits equity due to limited liability." },
  { question: "What do debt-holders anticipate in the asset substitution example?", answer: "They expect Project B to be chosen and reduce what they're willing to lend accordingly." },

  // Practical Examples
  { question: "What are real-world signs of asset substitution?", answer: "Spin-offs of safer divisions, delaying liquidation, excessive dividends/share repurchases." },

  // Debt Overhang
  { question: "What is the debt overhang problem?", answer: "Equity-holders may reject positive NPV projects if the gains mostly benefit debt-holders." },
  { question: "Why does debt overhang lead to underinvestment?", answer: "New investment increases firm value but not equity value due to prior debt claims." },

  // Debt Overhang Example
  { question: "In the debt overhang example, why is the project rejected?", answer: "Equity value decreases after funding the project, despite total firm value rising." },
  { question: "What are ways to solve debt overhang?", answer: "Issue senior debt, renegotiate existing debt, or find equity co-financing." },

  // Manager vs Shareholder Conflicts
  { question: "What is a common conflict between managers and shareholders?", answer: "Managers may favor empire building or projects that protect their position, not maximize value." },
  { question: "What are examples of managerial preference misalignment?", answer: "Early-payoff projects, fun/visible industries, projects aligned with manager’s skills." },

  // Moral Hazard & Capital Structure
  { question: "What is credit rationing due to managerial moral hazard?", answer: "Investors refuse to finance projects unless managers bear sufficient risk; some positive NPV projects go unfunded." },
  { question: "How can capital structure help solve moral hazard?", answer: "Debt reduces free cash flow and forces discipline via interest payments and bankruptcy risk." },

  // Implications of Leverage
  { question: "What are positive effects of debt on incentives?", answer: "Reduces free cash flow misuse, increases manager accountability (Jensen 1986, Grossman & Hart 1982)." },

  // Mitigation Tools
  { question: "What are ways to reduce conflict between debt and equity holders?", answer: "Use short-term debt, protective covenants, project financing, private debt contracts." },

  // Capital Structure Strategy
  { question: "When should a firm use more debt?", answer: "When it has high cash, few growth opportunities, and low expected distress costs." },
  { question: "When should a firm be conservative with debt?", answer: "When it has high growth opportunities and high distress costs." },

  // Polls
  { question: "Poll: Main Week 7 topic?", answer: "Conflicts between debtholders and shareholders." },
  { question: "Poll: Limited liability — who gets what if X < D?", answer: "Debtholders get X; shareholders get 0." },
  { question: "Poll: When is firm in financial distress (F=10, 40, 41, 50)?", answer: "When F = 40, 41, 50 (C and D)." },
  { question: "Poll: Examples of conflict outcomes?", answer: "Asset substitution, debt overhang, shortsighted investments, reluctance to liquidate." },
  { question: "Poll: UBS article – what conflict is most relevant?", answer: "Asset substitution (risk shifting)." },
  { question: "Poll: What inefficiency does asset substitution create?", answer: "Value-destroying projects that benefit shareholders." },
  { question: "Poll: What inefficiency does debt overhang create?", answer: "Firms pass up positive NPV projects that benefit debt-holders." },
  { question: "Poll: Why can't some NPV > 0 projects be financed?", answer: "Manager requires too large a stake to have incentive to exert effort." }
